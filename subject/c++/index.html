            C++ is just beginning its second decade. Unlike many other computer
            languages whose influence begins to wane over the years, cppâ€™s has
            grown stronger with the passage of time. cpp leapt to the forefront
            of Internet programming with its first release. Each subsequent
            version has solidified that position. Today, cpp is still the first
            and best choice for developing web-based applications.

                  Since the invention of the computers, many programming
                  approaches have been tried. These include techiniques such as
                  <i>modular programming</i>, <i>top-down programming</i>,
                  <i>bottom-up programming</i>, <i>structured programming</i>.
                  These techiniques became popular among programmers over the
                  last 2 decades.

                  On the arrival of <span class="fw-bold">C</span>, structured
                  programming became very popular in 1980s. But it failed to
                  show desired results in terms of bug-free, easy-to-maintain
                  and reusable programming.

                  is an approach which attempts to remove some of problems of
                  conventional programming. Languages that support OOP features
                  include Smalltalk, Objective C, C++, Ada and Object Pascal.
                  C++ is basically a procedural language with object-oriented
                  extension.

                <h4>Object-Oriented Paradigm</h4>
                <p>
                  Object-Oriented Programming treats data as important element
                  in the program development. OOP consists of a number of
                  entities called <span class="fw-bold">Objects</span>. The data
                  of an object can be accessed only by the methods associated
                  with that object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An object is considered to be partitioned area of computer
                  that stores data and a set of operations that can access the
                  data. Some features of Object-Oriented Paradigm are:

                <h4>Basic Concepts of Object Oriented Programming</h4>
                <p>
                  Now we are going to discuss the general concepts of
                  object-oriented programming which from the heart of java
                  language.
                </p>
                <h5>Objects and Classes</h5>
                <p>
                  As real World, Objects are persons or any place or data, in
                  object oriented system, objects are the basic entities that
                  can be identified distinctly. Any programming problem is
                  analyzed in terms of object. As discussed before, object takes
                  up space and memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A class is a protoype or blueprint which defines the methods
                  of object. A class can be thought as a 'datatype' and an
                  object as a 'variable' of that datatype. A class is the
                  collection of objects of similar type.
                </p>
                <h5>Data Abstraction and Encapsulation</h5>
                <p>
                  Data Abstraction is the method of hiding irrelavant
                  information from user. Abstraction means representing
                  essential features excluding background details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Encapsulation can be defined as the process to wrap the data
                  and methods into a single unit. Outside world is not permitted
                  to access the data and only those methods or functions which
                  are encapsulated, can access. A class is an example of
                  encapsulation.
                </p>
                <h5>Inheritance</h5>
                <p>
                  Inheritance is the mechanism by which objects of one class can
                  acquire the properties of another class. It emphasis the
                  reusability of code. This means we can add additional features
                  to an existing class without modifying it.
                </p>
                <h5>Polymorphism</h5>
                <p>
                  It means the ability to appear in many forms. Let consider the
                  example of operation of addition. If the operands are numbers,
                  the operation will generate sum. If the operands are strings,
                  then the operation would produce a third string by
                  concatenation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are 2 types of polymerphism : Runtime and Complie Time
                </p>
                <p>
                  Compile time polymerphism may refer to the operations
                  performed by the compiler such as syntax analysis, or the pre
                  run-time assesment of the program's behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Run time polymerphism is the time period when a syntax correct
                  program is actucally executed in the computer system.
                </p>
                <h5>Dynamic Binding</h5>
                <p>
                  It refers to the linking of a procedure call to the code to be
                  executed in response to the call. Dynamic binding means that
                  the code associated with a given procedure call is not known
                  until the time of the at runtime
                </p>

                C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was first
                developed in the 1980s as an extension of the C programming
                language. It is a compiled language, which means that programs
                written in C++ are translated into machine code by a compiler
                before being executed. C++ is known for its speed, efficiency,
                and powerful features, which have made it a popular choice for a
                wide range of applications, including operating systems, video
                games, financial systems, and scientific simulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the main advantages of C++ is its support for
                object-oriented programming (OOP). C++ allows programmers to
                define classes, which encapsulate data and behavior into a
                single entity. This makes it easier to manage and maintain
                complex programs by breaking them down into smaller, more
                manageable pieces. In addition to OOP, C++ also supports other
                programming paradigms, such as procedural programming and
                generic programming.
              </p>
              <p>
                C++ has a rich set of features that make it a powerful and
                flexible language. Some of its key features include

              <h4>Tokens in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming, a token is the smallest individual unit of a
                program. A 'C' program consists of various types of tokens,
                which can be classified into the following categories:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Keywords: </span>Keywords are reserved
                words that have a specific meaning in the C language. Examples
                include if, else, for, while, return, and void.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Identifiers: </span>Identifiers are names
                given to variables, functions, and other entities in a C
                program. An identifier can consist of letters, digits, and
                underscores. It must start with a letter or an underscore.
                Examples of identifiers include sum, i, j, and my_function.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Constants: </span>Constants are fixed
                values that cannot be changed during program execution. C
                supports various types of constants such as integer constants,
                floating-point constants, character constants, and string
                constants. Examples include 42, 3.14, 'a', and "Hello World".

                <span class="fw-bold">Operators: </span>Operators are symbols
                that perform mathematical or logical operations on operands. C
                supports various types of operators such as arithmetic

              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Special symbols: </span>These are used to

                It is important to note that whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line
                breaks) is not considered a token in C programming.

              <h4>Datatypes in C</h4>
              <p>
                Datatypes specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C
                supports a variety of data types, including:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">int: </span>These data types are used to
                store integer values, which can be positive, negative, or zero.
                C supports four integer data types: char (1 byte), short (2
                bytes), int (2 or 4 bytes), and long (4 or 8 bytes).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">float: </span>These data types are used to
                store real numbers with decimal places. C supports two
                floating-point data types: float (4 bytes) and double (8 bytes).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">char: </span>The char data type is used to
                store a single character value, such as a letter or digit. It
                takes up 1 byte of memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to these basic data types, C also allows for the
                creation of user-defined data types, such as structures and
                enums.

              <p>
                In C programming, operators are symbols or keywords that perform
                various operations on data. Operators in C can be classified
                into the following categories:
              </p>

                <span class="fw-bold">Arithmetic operators: </span>These
                operators perform mathematical operations such as addition,

                Examples of arithmetic operators in C include +, -, *, /, and %.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Relational operators: </span>These
                operators compare two values and return a Boolean value of true
                or false. Examples of relational operators in C include <, >,
                <=, >=, ==, and !=.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Logical operators: </span>These perform
                logical operations on Boolean values and return a Boolean value
                of true or false. Examples of logical operators in C include &&
                (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).

              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Bitwise operators: </span>These operators
                perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.
                Examples of bitwise operators in C include & (bitwise AND), |
                (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), and ~ (bitwise NOT).

              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Increment and decrement operators: </span>
                These are used to increment or decrement the value of a
                variable. Examples of these operators in C include ++
                (increment), and -- (decrement).

                <span class="fw-bold">Conditional operator: </span>The
                conditional operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else
                statement. It takes three operands and returns one of two values
                based on a Boolean condition. The syntax for the conditional
                operator in C is condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false.

                <span class="fw-bold">Preprocessor Directives: </span>
                These are special instructions to the preprocessor to include
                header files that provide declarations of functions and macros.
                Preprocessor directives are placed at the beginning of the
                program and start with the "#" symbol.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Global Declarations: </span>
                These are declarations of variables, functions, and objects that
                will be used throughout the program. Global declarations are
                placed after the namespace declarations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Function Declarations: </span>
                These are declarations of functions that will be defined later
                in the program. Function declarations are placed after the
                global declarations.

              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Function Definitions: </span>
                These are the actual implementations of the functions declared

              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Main Function: </span>
                It is the entry point of the program, where the program
                execution begins. The main function is required in every C++
                program and is defined as follows:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int main() {

                These are the actual instructions that perform the tasks of the
                program. Statements are placed inside the main function. Here's
                an example program that demonstrates the structure of a C++
                program:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
// Preprocessor Directive
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

// Global Declaration
int x = 42;

// Function Declaration
int add(int a, int b);

// Function Definition
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Main Function
int main() {
  // Statements
  int y = 10;
  int z = add(x, y);
  cout &lt;&lt; "The sum of " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " and " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; " is " &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}</pre

              </code>
              <p>
                In above program, the preprocessor directive "#include
                &lt;iostream&gt;" is used to include the standard input/output
                library, the global declaration "int x = 42;" declares a global
                variable, the function declaration "int add(int a, int b);"
                declares a function, the function definition "int add(int a, int
                b) { return a + b; }" defines the function, and the main
                function contains the statements that perform the task of the
                program.

              <h4>Expression and Control Structure</h4>
              <p>
                An expression is a combination of literals, variables,
                operators, and function calls that evaluate to a value. For
                example, the following is an expression in C++:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y;</pre

              </code>
              <p>
                Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in
                a program. There are three types of control structures in C++:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
 int x = 10;
 if (x > 5) {
 cout &lt;&lt; "x is greater than 5" &lt;&lt; endl;
} </pre
                >
              </code>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Loop</h5>
              <p>
                Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. The most
                common types of loops are the for loop, the while loop, and the
                do-while loop. Here's an example of a for loop:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
   cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
 }</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the loop will execute 5 times, with the
                variable i taking on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
              </p>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Jump</h5>
              <p>
                Jump statements allow you to transfer control to a different
                part of the program. The most common types of jump statements
                are break, continue, and return. Here's an example of a break
                statement inside a loop:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  if (i == 3) {
    break;
  }
  cout &lt; i &lt; endl;
}</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the loop will execute 3 times, with the
                variable i taking on the values 0, 1, and 2. When i is equal to
                3, the break statement is executed, causing the loop to
                terminate early.

              <h4>Function in C++</h4>
              <p>
                Functions are a fundamental part of programming in C++. A
                function is a block of code that performs a specific task, and
                can be called from other parts of the program as needed. In C++,
                functions are declared using a function prototype, and defined
                using a function definition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's an example of a simple function that takes two arguments
                and returns their sum:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the function is named sum, and takes two
                arguments of type int. Inside the function, the arguments are
                added together, and the result is returned using the return
                keyword.
              </p>
              <p>
                Functions can be called from other parts of the program using
                their name, and passing the necessary arguments. For example:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = sum(x, y);</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the sum function is called with the values of
                x and y, and the result is stored in the variable z.
              </p>
              <p>
                Functions can also be declared with default arguments, which are
                used when the function is called without providing a value for
                that argument. For example:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int multiply(int a, int b = 2) 
{ return a * b; }</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the multiply function takes two arguments,
                with a default value of 2 for the second argument. If the
                function is called with only one argument, the second argument
                will default to 2.
              </p>
              <p>
                C++ also supports function overloading, which allows you to
                define multiple functions with the same name, but different
                parameters. For example:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
 int sum(int a, int b) 
 { return a + b; }
 double sum(double a, double b)
 { return a + b; }</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the sum function is defined twice, once for
                int arguments, and once for double arguments. When the function
                is called, the appropriate version is automatically selected
                based on the types of the arguments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Functions are a powerful tool for organizing and structuring
                code in C++, and are used extensively in real-world
                applications.
              </p>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Type of Functions</h5>
              <p>
                In C++, there are several types of functions based on their
                return type, arguments, and purpose. Here are the most common
                types of functions in C++:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Void Function:</span>
                A void function is a function that does not return any value. It
                is commonly used when the primary purpose of the function is to
                perform some action or side-effect, such as printing output to
                the console or modifying global variables.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Functions with Return Type: </span>
                A function with return type is a function that returns a value
                of a specified data type. These functions are used when the
                primary purpose of the function is to perform some calculation
                or operation and return a value to the calling code.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Functions with Arguments: </span>
                A function with arguments is a function that takes one or more
                parameters or arguments. These parameters are inputs to the
                function and can be used inside the function to perform some
                computation. Arguments can be passed by value, by reference or
                by pointer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Inline Functions: </span>
                An inline function is a function that is expanded in-line at the
                point of use, rather than being called as a separate function.
                This can lead to faster execution times, since the overhead of
                function calls is eliminated. Inline functions are typically
                used for small, frequently called functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Overloaded Functions: </span>
                An overloaded function is a function that has the same name as
                one or more other functions, but with different parameters. The
                correct function to call is determined based on the number and
                types of the arguments provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are just a few of the common types of functions in C++. By
                using these different types of functions, you can create
                powerful and flexible programs that can perform a wide range of
                tasks
              </p>

          </div>
          <div id="cpp-unit-2">
            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">Defining Member Function</h5>
            <p>
              In C++, member functions are functions that are defined inside a
              class and can access the properties and methods of that class.
              Member functions can be defined in the class declaration itself or
              in a separate implementation file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's an example of a class definition with a member function
              defined in the class declaration:
            </p>
            <code>
              <pre>
class Rectangle {
  private:
    int width, height;
  public:
   void set_values(int w, int h)
    {
      width = w;
      height = h;
    }
    int area() {
      return width * height;
    }
}; </pre
              >
            </code>
            <p>
              In above example, the Rectangle class has two private properties
              (width and height) and two public member functions (set_values and
              area). The set_values function is used to set the values of the
              width and height properties, while the area function calculates
              and returns the area of the rectangle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Member functions can also be defined outside of the class
              declaration, in a separate implementation file. Here's an example
              of a Rectangle class declaration in a header file (Rectangle.h)
              and its implementation in a source file (Rectangle.cpp):
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Rectangle.h:</p>
            <code>
              <pre>
class Rectangle {
  private:
    int width, height;
  public:
    void set_values(int w, int h);
    int area();
};</pre
              >
            </code>
            <p class="fw-bold">Rectangle.cpp:</p>
            <code>
              <pre>
#include "Rectangle.h"

void Rectangle::set_values(int w, int h) 
{
  width = w;
  height = h;
}

int Rectangle::area() {
  return width * height;
} </pre
              >
            </code>
            <p>
              In above example, the set_values and area member functions are
              defined in the Rectangle.cpp source file using the scope
              resolution operator <code>::</code>. The Rectangle.h header file
              is used to declare the class and its member functions, which are
              then implemented in the source file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Defining member functions in C++ allows you to encapsulate the
              behavior of an object within the object itself, making it easier
              to understand and maintain your code. It also allows you to create
              reusable code, since you can create multiple objects of the same
              class and use the same member functions to manipulate them.
            </p>
            <h4>Constructors</h4>
            <p>
              In C++, a constructor is a special member function of a class that
              is called automatically when an object of that class is created.
              The constructor is used to initialize the properties of the object
              and perform any other setup that is needed before the object can
              be used.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of a class with a constructor:</p>
            <code>
              <pre>
 class Person {
   private:
     string name;
     int age;
   public:
     Person(string n, int a) 
     {
       name = n;
       age = a;
     }
 };</pre
              >
            </code>
            <p>
              In above example, the Person class has two private properties
              (name and age) and a public constructor that takes two arguments
              (n for name and a for age). The constructor initializes the name
              and age properties of the object using the values passed as
              arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
              When an object of the Person class is created, the constructor is
              automatically called with the specified arguments. For example,
              you could create a Person object like this:
            </p>
            <code><pre>Person john("John Doe", 30);</pre></code>
            <p>
              In above example, the john object is created with the name "John
              Doe" and age 30. The constructor is called automatically with
              these arguments to initialize the name and age properties of the
              object.
            </p>
            <p>
              Constructors can also have default values for their parameters,
              allowing you to create objects with default values for some
              properties. Here's an example of a constructor with default
              parameter values:
            </p>
            <code>
              <pre>
 class Person {
   private:
     string name;
     int age;
   public:
     Person(string n = "", int a = 0)
     {
       name = n;
       age = a;
     }
 };</pre
              >
            </code>
            <p>
              In above example, the Person constructor takes two parameters with
              default values (n defaults to an empty string and a defaults to
              0). This allows you to create Person objects with default values
              for the name and age properties:
            </p>
            <code>
              <pre>
Person jane; 
/* creates a Person object with 
default values for name and age */ </pre
              >
            </code>
            <h5 class="fw-bold">Type of Constructors</h5>
            <p>
              In C++, there are several types of constructors that can be
              defined in a class:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="fw-bold">Default constructor: </span>
              A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. If
              a class does not have any constructors defined, the compiler will
              automatically generate a default constructor. This constructor
              initializes all properties of the object to their default values.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="fw-bold">Parameterized constructor: </span>
              A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or
              more arguments. This constructor is used to initialize the
              properties of the object with the values passed as arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="fw-bold">Copy constructor: </span>
              A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the
              same class as an argument. This constructor is used to create a
              new object with the same properties as the argument object.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of each type of constructor:</p>
            <code>
              <pre>
 class Person {
   private:
     string name;
     int age;
   public:
     // Default constructor
     Person() {
       name = "";
       age = 0;
     }
 
     // Parameterized constructor
     Person(string n, int a) {
       name = n;
       age = a;
     }
 
     // Copy constructor
     Person(const Person& other) {
       name = other.name;
       age = other.age;
     }
 };</pre
              >
            </code>
            <p>
              In above example, the Person class has a default constructor that
              initializes the name and age properties to their default values, a
              parameterized constructor that takes a string and an integer as
              arguments to initialize the name and age properties, a copy
              constructor that takes a const reference to another Person object
              and copies its name and age properties, and a move constructor
              that takes an rvalue reference to another Person object and moves
              its name and age properties into a new object.
            </p>

            <div id="destructor-block">
              <h4>Destructors</h4>
              <p>
                In C++, a destructor is a special member function of a class
                that is called automatically when an object of that class is
                destroyed. The destructor is used to clean up any resources that
                were allocated by the object during its lifetime.
              </p>
              <p>Here's an example of a class with a destructor:</p>
              <code>
                <pre>
 class Person {
   private:
     string* name;
   public:
     Person(string n) {
       name = new string(n);
     }
     ~Person() {
       delete name;
     }
 };</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, the Person class has a private property name,
                which is a pointer to a string. The public constructor of the
                class takes a string argument n, allocates memory for the name
                pointer using the new operator, and initializes it with the
                value of n.
              </p>
              <p>
                The class also has a destructor, which is called automatically
                when an object of the class is destroyed. The destructor
                deallocates the memory that was allocated for the name pointer
                using the delete operator.
              </p>
              <p>
                When an object of the Person class is created, memory is
                allocated for the name pointer using the new operator. When the
                object is destroyed, the destructor is called automatically and
                deallocates the memory using the delete operator.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's important to note that if a class does not have a
                destructor, the compiler will generate a default destructor that
                does nothing. However, if a class allocates any resources during
                its lifetime, it's important to define a destructor to properly
                deallocate those resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, it's worth noting that a destructor is only called once
                for each object, when the object is destroyed. If an object is
                created on the stack, the destructor is called automatically
                when the object goes out of scope. If an object is created on
                the heap using the new operator, the destructor must be called
                manually using the delete operation.

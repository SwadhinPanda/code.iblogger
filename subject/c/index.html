              <p>
                C is a general-purpose programming language that was first
                developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It
                is widely used for system programming, developing operating
                systems, embedded systems, and other low-level programming
                tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                C is a high-level language with features such as data types,
                control structures, functions, and arrays. It is a compiled
                language, which means that the source code is translated into
                machine code by a compiler before it can be executed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some important concepts in C programming include variables,
                which are used to store values, and functions, which are
                reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Control
                structures, such as loops and conditionals, are used to control
                the flow of execution in a program.
              </p>
              <p>
                C has influenced many other programming languages, and is still
                widely used today, especially in operating system development
                and other low-level programming tasks.

              <h4>Tokens in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming, a token is the smallest individual unit of a
                program. A 'C' program consists of various types of tokens,
                which can be classified into the following categories:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Keywords: </span>Keywords are reserved
                words that have a specific meaning in the C language. Examples
                include if, else, for, while, return, and void.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Identifiers: </span>Identifiers are names
                given to variables, functions, and other entities in a C
                program. An identifier can consist of letters, digits, and
                underscores. It must start with a letter or an underscore.
                Examples of identifiers include sum, i, j, and my_function.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Constants: </span>Constants are fixed
                values that cannot be changed during program execution. C
                supports various types of constants such as integer constants,
                floating-point constants, character constants, and string
                constants. Examples include 42, 3.14, 'a', and "Hello World".
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Operators: </span>Operators are symbols
                that perform mathematical or logical operations on operands. C
                supports various types of operators such as arithmetic
                operators, relational operators, logical operators, and bitwise
                operators. Examples include + - * / < > && || &
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Special symbols: </span>These are used to
                indicate the beginning or end of a statement, block of code, or
                function. Examples include , ; { } ( )
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important to note that whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line
                breaks) is not considered a token in C programming.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="c-datatypes mt-3" id="c-datatypes">
              <h4>Datatypes in C</h4>
              <p>
                Datatypes specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C
                supports a variety of data types, including:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">int: </span>These data types are used to
                store integer values, which can be positive, negative, or zero.
                C supports four integer data types: char (1 byte), short (2
                bytes), int (2 or 4 bytes), and long (4 or 8 bytes).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">float: </span>These data types are used to
                store real numbers with decimal places. C supports two
                floating-point data types: float (4 bytes) and double (8 bytes).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">char: </span>The char data type is used to
                store a single character value, such as a letter or digit. It
                takes up 1 byte of memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to these basic data types, C also allows for the
                creation of user-defined data types, such as structures and
                enums.

              <h4>Operators in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming, operators are symbols or keywords that perform
                various operations on data. Operators in C can be classified
                into the following categories:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Arithmetic operators: </span>These
                operators perform mathematical operations such as addition,
                subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder).
                Examples of arithmetic operators in C include +, -, *, /, and %.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Relational operators: </span>These
                operators compare two values and return a Boolean value of true
                or false. Examples of relational operators in C include <, >,
                <=, >=, ==, and !=.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Logical operators: </span>These perform
                logical operations on Boolean values and return a Boolean value
                of true or false. Examples of logical operators in C include &&
                (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Bitwise operators: </span>These operators
                perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.
                Examples of bitwise operators in C include & (bitwise AND), |
                (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), and ~ (bitwise NOT).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Assignment operators: </span>These
                operators are used to assign values to variables. Examples of
                assignment operators in C include =, +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Increment and decrement operators: </span>
                These are used to increment or decrement the value of a
                variable. Examples of these operators in C include ++
                (increment), and -- (decrement).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Conditional operator: </span>The
                conditional operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else
                statement. It takes three operands and returns one of two values
                based on a Boolean condition. The syntax for the conditional
                operator in C is condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false.

              <h4>Control Structures</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming, control structures are used to control the
                flow of a program. C provides several types of control
                structures, including:
              </p>
              <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Conditional Statements</p>
              <p>
                Conditional statements are used to execute a certain block of
                code based on a condition. C provides two conditional
                statements: the if statement and the switch statement. The if
                statement executes a block of code if a condition is true, while
                the switch statement allows for multiple conditions to be
                tested.
              </p>
              <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Loop statements</p>
              <p>
                Loop statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
                C provides three types of loop statements: the while loop, the
                do-while loop, and the for loop. The while loop executes a block
                of code while a condition is true, the do-while loop executes a
                block of code at least once and then repeatedly while a
                condition is true, and the for loop is used to execute a block
                of code a specific number of times.
              </p>
             <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Jump statements</p>
              <p>Jump statements are used to change the normal sequence of execution in a program. C provides three types of jump statements: the break statement, the continue statement, and the goto statement. The break statement is used to exit a loop, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop, and the goto statement is used to jump to a specific label in the code.
              </p>
             <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Function calls</p>
              <p>Function calls are used to execute a block of code that is contained in a function. Functions allow for modular programming and code reusability.
              </p>
              <p>By using these control structures, programmers can write complex programs that execute specific actions based on various conditions and inputs. Proper use of control structures can improve the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of a program.

              <h4>Loops in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming, loops are used to execute a block of code
                repeatedly until a certain condition is met. C provides three
                types of loop statements: while loop, do-while loop, and for
                loop.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">While Loop:</span>
                This loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is
                true. The syntax for the while loop is as follows:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  while (condition) {

}</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop, and
                the loop continues as long as the condition is true.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">While Loop:</span>
                Executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly as
                long as a condition is true. The syntax for the do-while loop is
                as follows:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  do{
    //code to be executed
  } while (condition);</pre
                >

              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">For Loop: </span>
                For loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of
                times. The syntax for the for loop is as follows:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {

                The initialization is performed before the loop starts, the
                condition is checked before each iteration of the loop, and the
                increment/decrement is performed at the end of each iteration of
                the loop.

              <p>
                In addition to these loop statements, C also provides the break

                By using these loop statements and control structures,

              <h4>Arrays in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same data
                type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element in an
                array can be accessed by its index or position in the array,
                starting from 0.
              </p>
              <p>Arrays are declared using the following syntax:</p>
              <code>
                <pre>data_type array_name[array_size];</pre>
              </code>
              <p>
                where "data_type" is the data type of the elements in the array,
                "array_name" is the name of the array, and "array_size" is the
                number of elements in the array.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, to declare an array of integers with 5 elements:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>int my_array[5];</pre>
              </code>
              <p>
                To initialize the array with values, we can use the following
                syntax:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
data_type array_name[array_size] = {value1, value2, ..., valueN};</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                where value1, value2, and valueN are the initial values for the
                first, second, and Nth element of the array, respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, to initialize an array of integers with the values
                1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>int my_array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};</pre>
              </code>
              <p>
                We can access individual elements in an array using their index,
                like this:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
my_array[0] // first element in the array (value is 1)
my_array[1] // second element in the array (value is 2)
my_array[2] // third element in the array (value is 3)
// and so on...</pre

              <h4>Pointers in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of
                another variable. Pointers are declared using the asterisk (*)
                symbol, and they are used to manipulate and access memory
                directly.
              </p>
              <p>The syntax to declare a pointer in C is as follows:</p>
              <code><pre>data_type *pointer_name;</pre></code>
              <p>
                Here, "data_type" is the data type of the variable that the
                pointer will point to, and "pointer_name" is the name of the
                pointer.
              </p>
              <p>For example, to declare a pointer to an integer variable:</p>
              <code><pre>int *my_pointer;</pre></code>
              <p>
                To assign a value to a pointer, we can use the address-of
                operator (&) to get the memory address of a variable:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int my_variable = 42;
int *my_pointer = &my_variable;</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                This sets "my_pointer" to point to the memory address of
                "my_variable".
              </p>
              <p>
                To access the value of the variable that a pointer is pointing
                to, we use the dereference operator (*):
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
int my_variable = 42;
int *my_pointer = &my_variable;
printf("The value of my_variable is: %d\n", *my_pointer);</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>This will output: "The value of my_variable is: 42".</p>
              <p>
                Pointers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as dynamic
                memory allocation, passing parameters to functions by reference,
                and accessing memory-mapped hardware registers. However, they
                also require careful management to avoid bugs like null pointer
                dereference and memory leaks.

              <h4>Structures in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming language, structures are used to define a
                user-defined data type. A structure is a collection of different
                data types under a single name. Each member of a structure can
                have a different data type.
              </p>
              <p>The syntax for defining a structure is:</p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  struct structure_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    .
    .
    .
    data_type memberN;
 };</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                Here, "structure_name" is the name of the structure and member1,
                member2, ..., memberN are the members of the structure. Each
                member is declared with its data type.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's an example of a structure that represents a person's
                information:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
   struct person {
     char name[50];
     int age;
     float height;
 };</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, <code>person</code> is the name of the
                structure, and it has three members:
                <code> name, age, and height</code>. <code>name</code> is a
                character array of length 50, <code>age</code> is an integer,
                and <code>height</code> is a floating-point number.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a structure is defined, we can create variables of that
                structure type:
              </p>
              <code><pre>struct person p1;</pre></code>
              <p>
                Here, <code>p1</code> is a variable of type person. We can
                access its members using the dot (.) notation:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
strcpy(p1.name, "John");
p1.age = 30;
p1.height = 5.8;</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                Here, we are assigning values to the members of <code>p1</code>.
                We can also pass a structure as an argument to a function:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
   void print_person(struct person p) {
     printf("Name: %s\n", p.name);
     printf("Age: %d\n", p.age);
     printf("Height: %f\n", p.height);
 }</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                Here, we are defining a function that takes a person structure
                as an argument and prints its members. We can call this function
                like this:
              </p>
              <code><pre>print_person(p1);</pre></code>
              <p>
                This will print the values of the members of <code>p1</code>
              </p>

            <div class="c-union" id="c-union">
              <h4>Union in C</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming language, a union is a user-defined data type
                that allows you to store different data types in the same memory
                location. In other words, a union is a variable that can hold
                different types of data at different times, but only one type at
                a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The syntax for defining a union is similar to that of a
                structure:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  union union_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    .
    .
    .
    data_type memberN;
 };</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                Here, <code>union_name</code> is the name of the union, and
                <code> member1, member2, ..., memberN</code> are the members of
                the union, each with its data type. The size of the union is
                determined by the largest member.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's an example of a union that can store an integer, a float,
                and a character array:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
  union data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, <code>data</code> is the name of the union,
                and it has three members: <code> i, f, str</code>. Each member
                has a different data type.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use a union, we can create a variable of that union type:
              </p>
              <code><pre>union data d;</pre></code>
              <p>
                Here, <code>d</code> is a variable of type data. We can assign a
                value to one member of the union and access it using another
                member:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
d.i = 10;

              <p>
                In above example, we are assigning a value to d.i and then
                printing it. We are then assigning a value to d.f and printing
                it. Finally, we are assigning a string to d.str and printing it.

                It's important to note that only one member of a union can be
                accessed at a time. When a new value is assigned to one member,
                the value of the other members is lost. Also, it's important to
                be careful when accessing members of a union, as it can lead to
                unexpected behavior if the wrong member is accessed.

              <h4>File Management</h4>
              <p>
                In C programming language, file management is done using the
                standard input/output library functions. These functions allow
                you to open, read, write, and close files.
              </p>
              <p>The main steps involved in file management in C are:</p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Opening a file: </span>
                To open a file, you can use the fopen() function, which takes
                two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which to
                open it. The mode can be "r" for reading, "w" for writing
                (overwriting if the file already exists), "a" for appending, or
                "r+", "w+", or "a+" for reading and writing.
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
FILE *fp;
fp = fopen("file.txt", "w");
if (fp == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening file\n");
    exit(1);
}</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, we are opening a file called 'file.txt' for
                writing. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the
                file cannot be opened, the program will exit with an error
                message.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Reading and writing data: </span>
                Once a file is opened, you can use the fscanf(), fprintf(),
                fgets(), and fputs() functions to read and write data to the
                file.
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
fprintf(fp, "Hello, world!\n");
char buffer[100];
fgets(buffer, 100, fp);</pre
                >
              </code>
              <p>
                In above example, we are using fprintf() to write the string
                "Hello, world!" to the file and then using fgets() to read a
                line from the file into a buffer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Closing the file: </span> When you are
                done with a file, you should close it using the fclose()
                function.
              </p>
              <code><pre>fclose(fp);</pre></code>
              <p>
                In above example, we are closing the file that we opened
                earlier.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's important to check for errors when opening and closing
                files, as well as when reading and writing data to files. Errors
                can occur if a file does not exist, if there is not enough disk
                space to write to a file, or if there is a problem with the disk
                itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's an example program that reads a file called input.txt and
                writes the contents to a file called output.txt:
              </p>
              <code>
                <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main() {
     FILE *in_fp, *out_fp;
     char buffer[100];
 
    in_fp = fopen("input.txt", "r");
    if (in_fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening input file\n");
        exit(1);
   }

    out_fp = fopen("output.txt", "w");
    if (out_fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening output file\n");
        exit(1);
    }

   while (fgets(buffer, 100, in_fp) != NULL) {
        fprintf(out_fp, "%s", buffer);
   }

    fclose(in_fp);
    fclose(out_fp);

     return 0;
   }
                </pre>

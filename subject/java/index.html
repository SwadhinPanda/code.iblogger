                Since the invention of the computers, many programming
                approaches have been tried. These include techiniques such as
                <i>modular programming</i>, <i>top-down programming</i>,
                <i>bottom-up programming</i>, <i>structured programming</i>.
                These techiniques became popular among programmers over the last
                2 decades.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the arrival of <span class="fw-bold">C</span>, structured
                programming became very popular in 1980s. But it failed to show
                desired results in terms of bug-free, easy-to-maintain and
                reusable programming.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="fw-bold">Object Oriented Programming</span>(OOP) is
                an approach which attempts to remove some of problems of
                conventional programming. Languages that support OOP features
                include Smalltalk, Objective C, C++, Ada and Object Pascal. C++
                is basically a procedural language with object-oriented
                extension.
              </p>
              <p>
                Java is a pure object-oriented language. After Java, the latest
                one is C#.

              <h4>Object-Oriented Paradigm</h4>
              <p>
                Object-Oriented Programming treats data as important element in
                the program development. OOP consists of a number of entities
                called <span class="fw-bold">Objects</span>. The data of an
                object can be accessed only by the methods associated with that
                object.
              </p>
              <p>
                An object is considered to be partitioned area of computer that
                stores data and a set of operations that can access the data.
                Some features of Object-Oriented Paradigm are:

              <h4>Basic Concepts of Object Oriented Programming</h4>
              <p>
                Now we are going to discuss the general concepts of
                object-oriented programming which from the heart of java
                language.
              </p>
              <h5>Objects and Classes</h5>
              <p>
                As real World, Objects are persons or any place or data, in
                object oriented system, objects are the basic entities that can
                be identified distinctly. Any programming problem is analyzed in
                terms of object. As discussed before, object takes up space and
                memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                A class is a protoype or blueprint which defines the methods of
                object. A class can be thought as a 'datatype' and an object as
                a 'variable' of that datatype. A class is the collection of
                objects of similar type.
              </p>
              <h5>Data Abstraction and Encapsulation</h5>
              <p>
                Data Abstraction is the method of hiding irrelavant information
                from user. Abstraction means representing essential features
                excluding background details.
              </p>
              <p>
                Encapsulation can be defined as the process to wrap the data and
                methods into a single unit. Outside world is not permitted to
                access the data and only those methods or functions which are
                encapsulated, can access. A class is an example of
                encapsulation.
              </p>
              <h5>Inheritance</h5>
              <p>
                Inheritance is the mechanism by which objects of one class can
                acquire the properties of another class. It emphasis the
                reusability of code. This means we can add additional features
                to an existing class without modifying it.
              </p>
              <h5>Polymorphism</h5>
              <p>
                It means the ability to appear in many forms. Let consider the
                example of operation of addition. If the operands are numbers,
                the operation will generate sum. If the operands are strings,
                then the operation would produce a third string by
                concatenation.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are 2 types of polymerphism : Runtime and Complie Time
              </p>
              <p>
                Compile time polymerphism may refer to the operations performed
                by the compiler such as syntax analysis, or the pre run-time
                assesment of the program's behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                Run time polymerphism is the time period when a syntax correct
                program is actucally executed in the computer system.
              </p>
              <h5>Dynamic Binding</h5>
              <p>
                It refers to the linking of a procedure call to the code to be
                executed in response to the call. Dynamic binding means that the
                code associated with a given procedure call is not known until
                the time of the at runtime
              </p>

              As you can see, this version of OverloadDemo does not define
              test(int). Therefore, when test( ) is called with an integer
              argument inside Overload, no matching method is found. However,
              Java can automatically convert an integer into a double, and this
              conversion can be used to resolve the call. Therefore, after
              test(int) is not found, Java elevates i to double and then calls
              test(double). Of course, if test(int) had been defined, it would
              have been called instead. Java will employ its automatic type
              conversions only if no exact match is found. Method overloading
              supports polymorphism because it is one way that Java implements
              the “one interface, multiple methods” paradigm. To understand how,
              consider the following. In languages that do not support method
              overloading, each method must be given a unique name. However,
              frequently you will want to implement essentially the same method
              for different types of data. Consider the absolute value function.
              In languages that do not support overloading, there are usually
              three or more versions of this function, each with a slightly
              different name. For instance, in C, the function abs( ) returns
              the absolute value of an integer, labs( ) returns the absolute
              value of a long integer, and fabs( ) returns the absolute value of
              a floating-point value. Since C does not support overloading, each
              function has to have its own name, even though all three functions
              do essentially the same thing. This makes the situation more
              complex, conceptually, than it actually is. Although the
              underlying concept of each function is the same, you still have
              three names to remember. This situation does not occur in Java,
              because each absolute value method can use the same name.
